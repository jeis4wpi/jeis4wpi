## Hi there 👋  John Eismeier here
- I enjoy all things science/math when using free open source software.

- Just had to in 2025:

[gnu elpa keyring update](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/gnu-elpa-keyring-update.html)

[better defaults](https://github.com/jamescherti/minimal-emacs.d)

- Moving to purcell after post-init.el unstable from better defaults.
